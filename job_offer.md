What is Attio?

CRMs are at the center of the software stack for millions of businesses. They're ubiquitous and totally essential, yet current products are completely archaic, unloved, and in massive need of an overhaul.



This is software that millions of people use for hours and hours a day – and a $50 billion category – yet you probably can't think of a single awesome piece of software in this space.



Attio is changing that. We’re building a radically new type of CRM that is incredibly flexible and as powerful as the most advanced CRM data models, but also as intuitive, delightful, and collaborative as today’s best software.



Attio is the CRM of the future: a living, breathing platform that connects with a customer’s GTM stack and evolves with them as they grow – from zero to IPO and beyond.



Why is this role important?

As a Senior Product Engineer at Attio you will design, implement and improve our backend infrastructure.



We are particularly interested in hearing from:

Engineers who have designed secure backend systems including common design criteria for systems such as authentication or data encryption
Excellent knowledge of modern cloud architectures including proprietary technologies offered by AWS and/or GCP


Whose team will you join?

You will join one of our four product teams focused on a key area of the product.



Internally, we work around two fundamental principles: Curiosity and Ownership. These values transcend the way we work and how our teams are structured.



We embrace Curiosity with a culture of open discussion and open access - making everything from financial metrics and customer conversation through to code and tooling open to every member of the team. Everyone on the team is welcome to question any aspect of the business and build greater understanding and input.



Through Ownership teams are responsible not just for the technical aspects of their work but also their own product and roadmap decisions. Everything from technical debt decisions through to feature planning is carried out at the team level.



In a culture without PM’s or tight deadlines, we are able to think from first principles and support each other across projects.



What is it like to work at Attio?

Attio employees are currently based in the US and Europe. We are all trusted to produce high-quality work in the environment that works best for us.



Attio is for people who own their role, learn quickly, are endlessly curious, and find happiness in delivering consistently brilliant outcomes that push the company forward. We love to work with people who are passionate about working this way and will do whatever it takes to get things done.



Kindness is evident in how we work and there is a high level of respect across the team thanks to working hard. This allows us all to challenge ideas, be independent, and attract world-class talent to join us.



What are the role requirements?

In this role, you will be expected to:

Contribute across the stack (Typescript/Node.js/GCP), including to our Web and Backend codebases, to help move the company and product forward
Design the architecture of new features to support our scale
Lead projects and make product decisions based on interactions with customers
Design REST API contracts for both internal and public consumers that are easy to work with and performant to implement
Be an advocate for innovative techniques and technologies that can improve our backend technology stack
Represent Attio’s Product & Engineering values both internally and externally


We believe the right person will have the following attributes:

Collaboration: Work with other members of the team to ensure that new and existing features are performant and secure
Communication: Excellent written communication skills including the ability to write long-form documentation of your work
Motivated: Enjoy solving problems and taking ownership of finding better solutions
Design: Have a natural appreciation of what a good product should look and feel like
